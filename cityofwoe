								Lost colours. 
	

	I fled through the rain to where the starved horses were. Where the black cities and beer set the snakes to twist in the other place. Eyes black and under them too. The windows were dripping. Everything in this place is slightly red. There are mirrors on the wall and tables with stools. It is shit. See she called from beyond with her pale skin and her lips like the berries in the North and that's where the sky thrashes. It thrashes like it's full of black riders riding through the torsion and alkahest, not the blackclouds heaving like saharan girls in ecstasy but like riders riding from the endless energy of life. Sick. Arabs. Blacks. Any and all of them I could feel the pangs of genocide. I could feel it burning and then I'd close my eyes and images of dreams of visions would climb up my spine and strangle me down to the muck and the burning. See there is a like a nigger in me. A niggers been in me for 10 years. You could call it something or call it nothing. You can't call anything what you want to call it. As soon as you name it it goes away. Or you grow it wrongly. Or it becomes what you called it. So. But I'd see her walking down Pender with her black hair and her body like a campfire and I'd spread dark wings in my room and think of her in a kind of oval like rippling pool. And I paint her with my finger on my stomach. Near my belly button I'd paint her. I'd drink. I'd drink. I could kill. I could kill. I could smile. I could smile. I could dance. I could dance. I could eat icecream on a bench. I could get a disease and where the hospital gown the wrong way so the nurses would see my cock. When I think about Arabia and arabians I think about sand and morons. See. She. Listless. Avelaval. Lavalavialia. Marisalalia. Water dripping on a leaf. A field of human bones. A world. Such a world. I'd meet some at the library. Sometimes fetch a little one. Tiny. Not near 85 pounds and fresh like morning flowers.
