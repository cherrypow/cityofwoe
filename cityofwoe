								Lost colours. 
	

I fled through the rain to where the starved horses were. Where the black cities and beer set the snakes to twist in the other place. Eyes black and under them too. The windows were dripping. Everything in this place is slightly red. There are mirrors on the wall and tables with stools. It is shit. See she called from beyond with her pale skin and her lips like the berries in the North and that's where the sky thrashes. It thrashes like it's full of black riders riding through the torsion and alkahest, not the blackclouds heaving like saharan girls in ecstasy but like riders riding from the endless energy of life. Sick. Arabs. Blacks. Any and all of them I could feel the pangs of genocide. I could feel it burning and then I'd close my eyes and images of dreams of visions would climb up my spine and strangle me down to the muck and the burning. See there is a like a nigger in me. A niggers been in me for 10 years. You could call it something or call it nothing. You can't call anything what you want to call it. As soon as you name it it goes away. Or you grow it wrongly. Or it becomes what you called it. So. But I'd see her walking down Pender with her black hair and her body like a campfire and I'd spread dark wings in my room and think of her in a kind of oval like rippling pool. And I paint her with my finger on my stomach. Near my belly button I'd paint her. I'd drink. I'd drink. I could kill. I could kill. I could smile. I could smile. I could dance. I could dance. I could eat icecream on a bench. I could get a disease and where the hospital gown the wrong way so the nurses would see my cock. When I think about Arabia and arabians I think about sand and morons. See. She. Listless. Temptress. Avelaval. Lavalavalia. Marisalalia. Water dripping on a leaf. A field of human bones. A world. Such a world. Meetings with rawlegs and innocence at the library. Not near 85 pounds and fresh like morning flowers.

					DOWN WE GO INTO THE CITY OF WOE. 

	I'll take you to where the rain thing spoke to me. It won't take too long. But I'll take you there. Because I have had so much time drinking on my own. 


	He was out with a friend at a bar on West Pender. It was halloween. There was merriment and costumes all about. And he sat there with a Scottish friend and thought about how it was possible to become such a nigger as he was. He told his friend what a nigger was. That it was something that had always been here. Something that had been around since existence birthed itself. It was a thing that was cold in the first explosion of that music of energies. Cold and burdened by its own cold and the streams of colour from all that other light and matter began to suck themselves away from it and at the same time burned it colder. Until it poised itself in a perpertual emptiness, in a mirrored empty hellscape where not a thing would budge or even eek. Only it could dream, fantasize, it could dream wild dreams against the suns burning on there courses of indifference, and on the nights when its vantage sifted in to the deeps and it could see the scapes of starwork brimming in light, like God had cursed it to watch the great dance unfold from its cruel and dark world, it could see the whole thing falling down, down it's throat to wrestle with the thousand snakes it had created. 
	He stepped outside for a cigarette and before him was a man in a wheelchair wearing a hospital gown. It was bitter cold outside. The man begged him for help. 
	I need money for a taxi. 
	His phone wasn't working. 
	He went inside and got his friends phone. Through a sea of figures. 
	We have to get this guy a taxi.
	Who?
	The nigger outside. 
	Alright. 
	They called him a taxi and paid the cab driver. Just take him back to the hospital. What the fuck is this guy doing here. 
	He sat for sometime and drank. Then he went to the bathroom. Then he kicked the toilet and cracked a piece of the top off and then he punched the wall until his hand started bleeding. Then he came out to see the arabs and the faggots drinking and the waitresses feared him and he took three whisky and took three more and tilted his head with his eyes all black and said to the bartender if you knew what is in my head you would never recover. 

	Then the night sang. On his way every streetlight sang and doubled and doubled again. And the crones creaked by him with noxious eyes and broken hearts and his boots were untied and he passed a fire on the road and his life was passing by too, passing and passing every second and everything burned. He had a coffee at small store and sat on a bench. Fat snowflake fell. She came off the bus looking perfect. She worked and she worked, 6 days a week 10 hour shifts then the busride to work and home another hour and that was it. 
	You drunk?
	Yes. You?
	No. 
	Ok. 
	There was a city in the sky made of Gold. There was an island hidden in the fog where pale girls bodies smelt like roses. A missile was in his head. Black bones, he said. Black bones and charred hopes, and everything breaking. 





Soft I thought about this machine I was certain I could create. A metaphysician, indeed. After getting milk and picking up the laundry and the toilet paper. Yes, a great seriousness confounds me. Need to go to Koodoo to get my phone fixed. Yes, black daggers and strange dreams. I remember a certain affliction from seeking what was in them out there on the street. In there hearts and in there eyes. We leave the haggard and the sick to be burned like puppies. Puppies with broken heads. We pour gasoline on them and set them on fire. We don't want to see them. We want to dance. Then I remember how cold the night was that night. When we were both drunk and I wanted to have her. The body curled up in the corner of the bed. Her legs corssed and her hands by her side and her hair so thick and full. The rain on the window. In the apartment building of the dead. Where sirens and knives and the crippled move along the alleyside. Where the children speak to me: speak, speak back, they'd say. For your life is going away. Everyday, Everyday. Your life is going away. And I'd wear the colored feathers in my room. The feathered headdress for I am alone all nights unless I get a beauty to follow me for some weeks. So I put the feathered headdress and I dance. I am shaping myself like
