  <h1>LOST COLOURS</h1>
  <p><em>By Avelaval</em></p>

  <div class="divider"></div>


<p>I fled through the rain to where the starved horses were. Where the black cities and beer set the snakes to twist in the other place. Eyes black and under them too. The windows were dripping. Everything in this place is slightly red. There are mirrors on the wall and tables with stools. It is shit. See she called from beyond with her pale skin and her lips like the berries in the North and that's where the sky thrashes. It thrashes like it's full of black riders riding through the torsion and alkahest, not the blackclouds heaving like Saharan girls in ecstasy but like riders riding from the endless energy of life. Sick. Arabs. Blacks. Any and all of them I could feel the pangs of genocide. I could feel it burning and then I'd close my eyes and images of dreams of visions would climb up my spine and strangle me down to the muck and the burning. See there is a like a nigger in me. A niggers been in me for 10 years. You could call it something or call it nothing. You can't call anything what you want to call it. As soon as you name it it goes away. Or you grow it wrongly. Or it becomes what you called it. So. But I'd see her walking down Pender with her black hair and her body like a campfire and I'd spread dark wings in my room and think of her in a kind of oval like rippling pool. And I'd paint her with my finger on my stomach. Near my belly button I'd paint her. I'd drink. I'd drink. I could kill. I could kill. I could smile. I could smile. I could dance. I could dance. See. She. Listless. Temptress. Avelaval. Lavalavalia. Marisalalia. Water dripping on a leaf. A field of human bones. A world. A world. Glows inside me.</p>

<p>He was out with a friend at a bar on West Pender. It was halloween. There was merriment and costumes all about. And he sat there with a Scottish friend and thought about how it was possible to become such a nigger as he was. He told his friend what a nigger was. That it was something that had always been here. Something that had been around since existence birthed itself. It was a thing that was cold in the first explosion of that music of energies. Cold and burdened by its own cold and the streams of colour from all that other light and matter began to suck themselves away from it and at the same time burned it colder. Until it poised itself in a perpertual emptiness, in a mirrored empty hellscape where not a thing would budge or even eek. Only it could dream, fantasize, it could dream wild dreams against the suns burning on there courses of indifference, and on the nights when its vantage sifted in to the deeps and it could see the scapes of starwork brimming in light, like God had cursed it to watch the great dance unfold from its cruel and dark world, it could see the whole thing falling down, down it's throat to wrestle with the thousand snakes it had created.</p>

<p>He stepped outside for a cigarette and before him was a man in a wheelchair wearing a hospital gown. It was bitter cold outside. The man begged him for help.</p>

<p>I need money for a taxi.</p>

<p>His phone wasn't working.</p>

<p>He went inside and got his friend's phone. Through a sea of figures.</p>

<p>We have to get this guy a taxi.</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>The nigger outside.</p>

<p>Alright.</p>

<p>They called him a taxi and paid the cab driver. Just take him back to the hospital. What the fuck is this guy doing here.</p>

<p>He sat for sometime and drank. Then he went to the bathroom. Then he kicked the toilet and cracked a piece of the top off and then he punched the wall until his hand started bleeding. Then he came out to see the arabs and the faggots drinking and the waitresses feared him and he took three whisky and took three more and tilted his head with his eyes all black and said to the bartender if you knew what is in my head you would never recover.</p>

<p>Then the night sang. On his way home every streetlight sang and doubled and doubled again. And the crones creaked by him with noxious eyes and broken hearts and his boots were untied and he passed a fire on the road and his life was passing by too, passing and passing every second and everything burned. He had a coffee at a small store and sat on a bench. Fat snowflakes fell. She came off the bus looking perfect. She worked and she worked, 6 days a week 10 hour shifts then the busride to work and home another hour and that was it.</p>

<p>You drunk?</p>

<p>Yes. You?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Ok.</p>

<p>There was a city in the sky made of Gold. There was an island hidden in the fog where pale girls bodies smelt like roses. A missile was in his head. Black bones, he said. Black bones and charred hopes, and everything breaking.</p>

<p>Soft I thought about this machine I was certain I could create. A metaphysician, After getting milk and picking up the laundry and the toilet paper. Yes, a great seriousness confounds me. Yes, black daggers and strange dreams. I remember a certain affliction from seeking what was in the addicts out there on the street. In their hearts and in their eyes. We leave the haggard and the sick to be burned like puppies. Puppies with broken heads. We pour gasoline on them and set them on fire. We don't want to see them. We want to dance. And I remember how cold the night was that night. When I was drunk and I gave her my whisky and I wanted to have her. The body curled up at the corner of the bed. Her legs corssed and her hands by her side and her hair so thick and full. And my hand pusling with pain. And the strippers in the dark where we went before. And the thousand addicts clinging to the lamposts before we came insisde. The rain on the window. In the apartment building of the dead. Where sirens and knives  move along the alleyside. Where the children speak to me: speak, speak back, they'd say. For your life is going away. Everyday, Everyday. Your life is going away. And I'd wear the colored feathers in my room. The feathered headdress for I was alone all nights unless I got a beauty to follow me sometime. So I'd put the feathered headdress on. And I'd birth myself in a mask. I'd lay down on the floor and breathe with my headdress on. And I'd put paint on my face and I'd dance. I'd see black spots in the air. I had a small picture I drew of a face with two spikes on either side and I'd tape it to the wall and put on the feathered headress on and I'd try to become the face. The creature in the face that I could become. And I'd close my eyes and move all my energy into the top of my skull and I'd breathe and I breathe and I breathe the higher air.</p>

<p>Her body as white as the moon. And the bedroom door a little open and that hot slat of light that comes from another room, just lighting so softly across her chest in a pale blue. The almond eyes.</p>

<p>She comes from a different planet. A different world. He is not of any. He is teetering foundationless. She dresses up. Her lips have small cracks on the bottom. And the lips are red. </p>

<p>She sees the nigger boots at the door. She feels the nigger heart sometimes. She can see the truth of the man but does not know the feathered mask is under the bed. The truth? Slaking wolves in the woods. The cold wind cursing the leaves to gnash. The faun helpless. It has tripped. The mother turns then runs. The snow exploding. Intactile silence heave between the pawsteps of the hunters. The fauns tongue is out. It wails and wails then goes silent. A meteorite threads and burns and dissolves into its final reckoning. The blood streams and falls onto the ground.</p>

<p>On another night he walked down Pender East and she was dressed like a child. Backpack, Pikachu toy dangling, a funny hat. They went under a scaffold of a construction building. The spiderlike shadows crossing them. On the street there were two police cars and a white sheet over something. Someone. She turned to him. He turned to her. But this was a different one. In his room he asked her. She said five years ago when she was twenty five she had many boys. A Shinjuku boy, a Tokyo boy, an Osaka boy. She'd take the train after work across the mazes of Tokyo and into small apartmens where she'd unroll herself and sink her buckteeth into the shoulders of skinny men that spent there days coding or sober, alone, drawing ink-flowers. He thought he heard her say. But he didn't hear it. And his skin was white as bones. They'd go get cheeseburgers sometimes. Then play pool. Belly buttoned waitressess. Canadian girls with all the delirium and colloquial shit falling out there faces. Stussy one, Stussy two. Nigger who? Nigger you. He'd go alone and drink when she was busy. He wouldn't speak. He felt he would throw up if he got to know any of them. Because he could not tell them about the machine behind his eyes that was burning with violence and images, of grand sick objects leaving and entering his head like bats in a funhouse full of mirrors. Like closing your eyes to run with them out there in the forests in the snow, to drink the blood of the kill and snarl against the night and even the rain fears you when it touches your mangy coat, even the stars tremble when you run and the wind whispers to you and the meek preys eyes seek all days not to see the truth ranging against them, and your soul the violent world coming into there eyes.</p>

<p>You want to go snowboarding?</p>

<p>Yes. I go. She smiles.</p>

<p>Ok.</p>

<p>You go?</p>

<p>No. How are a you waitress and have money to go snowboarding?</p>

<p>I save.</p>

<p>He looked at her. Huh. Interesting.</p>

<p>Yes. And sometimes tips.</p>

<p>Oh, I buy too many cheesburgers.</p>

<p>Yes, she said. Too many cheeseburgers. She smiles again.</p>

<p>Yes. Cheeseburgers. The falling power of leaving. The machine comes in. Works with its fangs and leaks the poision that dances. And intestate creature that seeks to come back for black revenge for the nothing it left and its immoratality a debate. Cat dead. Cat alive. Cat dead. Cat alive. Black lead. Summer skies. Heaving breath and I could see through her skin the ribcage  like a vision of acid heaven. I could see her lips looked black. I could smell the childish breath. Nato. The smell of garbage. The smell of her skin like lavender. Heal, nigger. Shut your sickness behind a door and bow before the houses of gold. They are building incredible things. Can't you see? World things made for the world. And you nigger? You are dripping down a rusty pipe, speaking to shades when the rain doesn't stop its ceasing. You are like a child of God. Yes. No. Where are you but lost in a world not like your own? Let's call her Zoa. And the other Salema.</p>

<p>They lost their colours like me.</p>

<p>He walked down a small laneway at night. With a small whisky bottle in his hand. He danced in the alley. He danced in the alley. There were bricks that were drinking too. The lamps were drinking too. He could see a spiderweb on a fan sticking out of a building. The spider was big and dark. There were flies in the web. He stood there for a long time and talked to himself about where he was going and what he was going to do. But he still could not remember anything. He could not remember what he was going to do.</p>

<p>She had left and he was alone. And he spent his days working at places he did not want to work at. He spent his time moiling over a vision of a life. Of a machine he could create in his mind that would open up the world. It would crack open the world he was in and he would become in that power and this world would become another one entire. His past steps would be annihilated. Everything he did would be cleared and annihilated. His own movements from then on would come from a whisper of where to go, and where not. What to say. And what not. Every idol would be tactfully destroyed as they are all destroyed everyday. Until there are none anymore. He would become the idol of himself and that self would be himself dissolved into others.</p>

<p>And so he worked on his machine. The machine to overcome everything. A machine to become a great visionary and the machines existence filled him with oddities beyond his comprehension. It began to work in him. Through him. As him. It began to show him signs of things. Growths of things. Images of things. Visions of people looking at him with tiny teeth covered in blood. Visions of great works not created and he would shutter at night until she told him ok I can meet you. I can meet you. We can meet at this place.</p>

<p>He sat there with her.</p>

<p>Are you ok tony?</p>

<p>Yes I'm ok.</p>

<p>The dark hair falling around her face.</p>

<p>Are you sure you ok?</p>

<p>I'm ok. I'm ok. I just thought of something I should do.</p>

<p>What?</p>

<p>Nothing.</p>

<p>Can we drink more alcohol?</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>I love alcohol.</p>

<p>I know. It's good.</p>

<p>She had a lot. And he took her home stumbling to his bed and lay her there and put the blanket over her.</p>

<p>She woke up. Where's my sister? Where's my sister?</p>

<p>You are just sleeping. You don't have a sister.</p>

<p>But where am I?</p>

<p>You're ok. Just sleep.</p>

<p>But I'm going home.</p>

<p>You're not going home.</p>

<p>I don't want to go home.</p>

<p>You're not going home.</p>

<p>I don't like home.</p>

<p>It happened again. And again. He couldn't finalize the machine. He wanted to but he couldn't. It was too difficult to understand. There was a figure in the machine so vastly intense and although it was his machine it seemed to have an intelligence of its own that could not be overcome. He couldn't return and answer to the figure to destroy it. He found the figure somewhere inside of himself and when he let him in he could not get him out. And he could not beat him. And he sat up in bed that night to discourse with vague oval shadows in the corner of his room.</p>

<p>Is it you?</p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>You know who.</p>

<p>It might be.</p>

<p>You are real.</p>

<p>I don't know. Who made me.</p>

<p>I did. But others have also?</p>

<p>Have you not seen me dancing? When you feel a rush. Is it not me who is dancing?</p>

<p>And you come from down the stairs.</p>

<p>Yes. I come from down the stairs.</p>

<p>But sometimes you make me want to weep. Because you believed in something. You believed that you create another world. Then he took that away from you.</p>

<p>I still have my play. I still play.</p>
